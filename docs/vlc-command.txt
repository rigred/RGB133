Instructions for using VLC with the Datapath Limited capture cards by using the command line.

Make sure that VLC is installed in the system before continuing.

== Installing VLC ==

To install in Ubuntu:
	1) Start the synaptic package manager
	2) Search for 'vlc'
	3) Right-click on the 'vlc' line and choose to "Mark for Installation"
	4) Click the "Apply" button and follow synaptic installation instructions

VLC has a man page which explains its function and options.

	$ man vlc

== Capturing ==
	
To start a capture using VLC (the Datapath Limited driver must already be loaded):
		$ vlc v4l2:// :v4l2-dev=/dev/video#
		$ vlc v4l2:///dev/video#             (VLC version 1.0.0 or greater)

NOTE: The following examples assume VLC version 0.9.9a.  Please adjust the syntax (as shown above) for VLC versions > 1.0.0.

To see verbose output from VLC:
		$ vlc -vvv v4l2:// :v4l2-dev=/dev/video#
	   
To change the V4L2 IO type [only READ and MMAP are supported by the driver]:
		$ vlc v4l2:// :v4l2-dev=/dev/video# :v4l2-io=[0|1]
			0 = READ
			1 = MMAP

vlc controls]:
