This document contains a basic guide to capturing audio with Datapath Limited capture cards.

Datapath Limited Vision Linux Driver supports the ALSA API for audio capture.
The user-side audio interface is the ALSA library API.

===== Discovering Audio Devices =====

Audio capture devices are registered as ALSA sound cards. arecord and aplay tools from package alsa-utils
can be used to discover ALSA devices.

To discover capture devices use:
    $ arecord -l

To discover playback devices use:
    $ aplay -l

===== Capturing with Third-Party Software =====

The driver has been tested to work with arecord, gst-launch, ffmpeg.
Example commands to simultaneously capture and play back the captured audio are:
    $ arecord -D hw:<a>,<b> -f <sample_format> -r <rate> -c <num_channels> -N | aplay -D hw:<x>,<y>
    
    $ gst-launch alsasrc device=hw:<a>,<b> ! audio/x-raw-int,format=<sample_format>,channels=<num_channels>,rate=<rate>
       ! alsasink device=hw:<x>,<y>

    $ ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:<a>,<b> -sample_fmt <sample_format> -ar <rate> -ac <num_channels> -f alsa hw:<x>,<y>

       - Replace <a> with capture card number, <b> with capture device number,
                 <x> with playback card number, <y> with playback device number,
                 <sample_format> with desired sample format,
                 <rate> with desired sample rate in Hz,
                 <num_channels> with desired number of channels.
                          
*Note that a sound card for playback is needed in the system to be able to output sound.
                          
===== Sample Application =====

Sample source is available in the utils directory which shows how to open, setup and capture audio through the ALSA library API. 

To build:
    $ cd <install_dir>/utils/
    $ make CaptureAudio
    
*Note that libasound2 library is needed.    
    
Usage:
    $ ./bin/CaptureAudio -h    
 
To discover ALSA devices:
    $ ./bin/CaptureAudio -l
    
To capture and play back with default capture and playback devices (first from the lists):
    $ ./bin/CaptureAudio
