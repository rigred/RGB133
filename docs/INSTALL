Installing the Datapath Limited Vision Linux Driver

The driver takes the form of a Linux wrapper surrounding a binary core.

To compile, install and load the driver execute the installation script:
	$ cd <PACKAGE BASE>
	$ ./scripts/install.kernel
	
   Note: The Split Kernel/User Mode Driver is no longer supported.
	
After a successful installation the driver module will be built, installed
and loaded into the kernel (with the User Space service running if the split
driver has been installed).  From this point on the kernel loadable module
and User Space service (if applicable) will be loaded each time the machine
is booted up.

Please note that it is possible that the installation package will contain a
newer version of firmware then the version stored on the Vision
card itself.  If this is the case, this firmware will be upgraded at
installation time.  Please see the FIRMWARE file for more information. 

To install the driver silently, and therefore automatically accept the
Datapath Limited Software License, add the -s switch to the installation command
line.  Installation will commence after 10 seconds, to cancel the install
press CTRL-C.

The driver supports the Video4Linux v2 API.  It has been noted however that
all V4L2 compliant applications appear to use the V4L2 API in different ways
so if you experience problems capturing from a Vision card please forward
details of your experience to support@datapath.co.uk.

If the jumper links have been used to set card ID(s), ordered symbolic links /dev/dada#
will be created linking to the real unordered V4L2 /dev/videoN device node.  If you wish
to use fixed order inputs, please use /dev/dada# as the video4linux device node in your
application or on the command line to your chosen capture application.

After installation, in the system log (/var/log/messages) you should see something similar to:

Uninstalling the Datapath Limited Vision Linux Driver

To uninstall the driver, execute the following commands:
   $ cd <PACKAGE BASE>
   $ ./scripts/uninstall.sh
   
 Please manually remove the installation directory <PACKAGE BASE>.
 
 A sample capture application is now included (V6.1.0.0 and later). This will be installed into the /usr/local/Vision/ directory.
 Please see the ERRATA for outstanding issues/bug in relation to the Vision capture application.
