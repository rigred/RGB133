 - Exclude control device from querying capabilities with VIDIOC_QUERYCAP ioctl.
 
   21/10/2014 PG
 - Fix script diag.sh so that it harvests all the diagnostic files irregardless of where the script is called from (this also solves the issue of the same origin for app Flash133).
 
   24/10/2014 PG
 - AUDIO: ALSA driver keeps track of created ALSA sound cards and removes accordingly at uninitialisation.
 - CaptureAudio sample application can query and list ALSA capture and playback devices; it can also select the capture/playback device to open.  
 
   29/10/2014 PG
 - AUDIO: Remove the timer and some functions related to virtual ALSA driver - the driver now works with real hardware. 
 
   10/11/2014 PG
 - For USERPTR I/O, set state of a buffer to QUEUED once the entire setup process for queueing the buffer is complete (this fixes the issue of occasional DMA-related lock-ups with USERPTR I/O). 
 
   11/11/2014 PG
 - AUDIO: Add setting rate, channels, and format to hardware at the driver and at application level. Remove the rest of the virtual-driver-related code.

   29/01/2015 PG
 - AUDIO: Fix system crashes on certain combinations of audio and video capture open / close.
 
   30/01/2015 PG

   20/02/2015 PG
 - Handle macro PREPARE_WORK removed from kernel 3.15.
 - AUDIO: handle new ALSA function for sound card registration: snd_card_new() which takes pci parent device as one of its arguments (function introduced by ALSA developers as part of work for modernising ALSA device structure).

   27/02/2015 PG
 - Add rgb133_diagnostics_mode to rgb133.conf, which allows gathering diagnostics with diag.sh under fault conditions.
 - As part of gathering diagnostics, add new information on dada devices and their mappings to: installinfo.txt, sysinfo.txt. 
 - In script diag.sh, get_rgbhelper_info() and get_edid_info() identify video capture devices by "dada" instead of "video", which narrows the search down to our devices.
 
   04/03/2015 PG
 - AUDIO: PulseAudio sources can now be used for capturing without noticeable sound artifacts: ALSA driver limits period size to half of the buffer size thus number of periods to 2.
   (before, it was possible to set buffer size to various numbers by tweaking default values in the PulseAudio daemon's configuration file, and that way artifacts could be introduced to the captured sound).   
 
   16/03/2015 PG
 - AUDIO: Add mute and volume controls.
 
   19/03/2015 PG
 - Handle pre-processor macro __devinitdata not existing in older kernels headers.

 - Fix usage of struct _KEVENT's member count in poll.
   
   05/08/2015 PG
 - In rgb133_dqbuf, wait for MultiBuffer event instead of waiting for DMAIdle (buffers are ready to be dequeued once MultiBuffer is signalled).
 - In rgb133_startdma, set MultiBuffer event on no signal. This fixes an unneeded wait for MultiBuffer in poll if there is a change from no signal to valid signal
   after rgb133_startdma finishes and before poll starts.
   
   07/08/2015 PG
 - Handle presence / absence of ioctl_lock in struct v4l2_device.

   05/11/2019 PG
 - Add new module load options to globally configure the following audio settings:
   digital mute, analog mute, analog balanced volume, analog unbalanced volume.
   Please note that the module load options listed above are applied to devices during the initialisation of audio interfaces. 
   Once the ALSA controls have been created, those settings may be overwritten which will occur when there is an active service manager.
   For example, alsa-restore.service would normally read the saved state from a file (for instance from /var/lib/alsa/asound.state) on boot
   and set the ALSA controls with the obtained values thus overwriting the audio module load options.
   Therefore, it is advised to use either the audio module options listed above or the service manager (as mutually exclusive mechanisms).
 - Fix an issue that could result in a capture freezing when closing [B# 31335].
 - Add support for kernel v4.12.14-6-rt.

   and scaling functionality.
 - Update the Capture sample source and the Vision sample application to implement the new ioctls.
 - Update kernel log prints with information on the crop and compose rectangles in the following form:
   Crop Rect: left, top, width, height;
   Compose Rect: left, top, width, height.

 - Resolve ./bin/rgb* and ./bin/dgc* archives to the '.o' extensions in order to fix linkage in newer kernels (>= 4.20.0).

   04/12/2020 PG
 - Update the sources of Vision Sample Application to Qt5; create the project file vw.pro.
 - Fix bug for the VIDIOC_ENUM_INPUT ioctl which resulted in member .name of struct v4l2_input 
   being filled with the same string across all channels of the queried video device [B# 53660].

   17/12/2020 PG
 - Add support for Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit with kernel 5.4.0-58-generic.
   Update COMPATIBILITY (Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit). 
 - Release the Vision Sample Application as source code.
   Add the sources, project file and documentation of the sample application to:
      ./apps/Vision
   Add the configuration generator script as:
      ./scripts/vwconfig.sh
   Add optional installation of the sample application to the driver installation script install.sh.
 - Add support for custom-defined image composition within the capture buffer
   which extends the V4L2 composing functionality to apply the V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE target.
 - Move utilities in the driver package from: ./utils to ./apps/utils.
