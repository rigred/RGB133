Instructions for using gst-launch with the Datapath Limited capture cards.

Make sure that the gstreamer tools and libraries are installed in the
system before continuing.

== Installing gst-launch ==

To install in Ubuntu:
   1) Start the synaptic package manager
   2) Search for 'gst-launch'
   3) Right-click on the 'gstreamer-tools' line and choose
      to "Mark for Installation"
   4) Click the "Apply" button and follow synaptic
      installation instructions

The gstreamer tools have a man page which explains their function
and options.

   $ man gst-launch

== Capturing ==
   
To start a capture using gst-launch (the Datapath Limited driver must already
be loaded):
      $ gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video# ! xvimagesink
         - Replace # with the desired video device number
      
The default capture resolution of gst-launc is 2046x2046.  To set a different
capture resolution:
      $ gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video# ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=<width>,height=<height> ! xvimagesink
         - Replacing <width> and <height> with the desired values

== gst-launch Advanced Options ==

To run gst-launch with verbose output:
      $ gst-launch -vvv v4l2src device=/dev/video# ! xvimagesink

To run gst-launch with an RGB pixel format:
      $ gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video# ! video/x-raw-rgb,bpp=<bpp> ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink
         - Replacing <bpp> with the bits per pixel required, 15 (5-5-5), 16 (5-6-5),
           24 (8-8-8), and 32 (8-8-8, with an extra empty byte for the alpha)
