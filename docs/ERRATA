================================================================

This Errata contains the latest known issues
in the Vision Linux driver.

For Release: 6.1.2.0 and later:

 - Split Kernel/User space driver can only handle one capture per channel for HD inputs of
   VisionRGB-E1/VisionRGB-E2/VisionRGB-E2S and one capture per channel on the
   HD input for VisionSD4+1.
 - Split Kernel/User space driver can only handle one capture per channel and only capture input 1 for SD
   inputs on VisionSD4+1 or VisionSD8.
 - Capture parameters are not persisted over a reboot.
 - Uninstall doesn't remove the initial installation directory (ie. the directory the installation package
   is unzipped into).
 - The Sample Vision capture application is currently intended to provide only a basic sample
   capture application using Qt. Options which are currently disabled (greyed out) may be implemented in
   a future release.  The is no accelerated drawing interface (ie. using OpenGL).
   A minimum version of Qt4.5 is required to run the sample Vision application.
